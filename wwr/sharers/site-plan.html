      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever regret throwing away some old stuffs that are still in good conditions just because you have no room to store them in your home? Do you want to put them into a good use instead of putting them in the landfill? My website helps to relocate unwanted old stuffs that are still in good conditions to others which are in need. Whenever “givers” have something they want to give away, they sign up in my website. “Takers” on the other hand can sign up on he other hand in order to request those second-hand items. It is just as easy as it sounds but it will make a difference in the world!</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>I have two main groups of intended audience: 1) people who want to clean up unuse items in their home but they do not want to put away them in the trash because of those items are still usable. 2) people who are in difficult situations in life and need to acquire certain necessities for free. They can both use my website to sign up as a "giver" or as a "taker", share items with each others.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

        Choices for Good<br><br>
        It is the time to clean up your room again. You did not realize that you have been actually living with a bunch of used postal boxes, clothes you rarely wear, and a lot of samll gidgets you like but have not been used for a long time on your desk until you look around your room.<br><br>
        What should be the first thing that come to your mind?<br><br>
        1) Throw them all away? No... Those things are quite new.<br>
        2) Store them somewhere in your home? No... All spaces have been occupied already...<br> 
        3) Sign up for "Sharers"? Yes! Join us today and start to give away reusable items with someone that is in need!

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I was born and raised in Hong Kong, one of the most crowded cities in the world, and I have been living here for over 30 years. Therefore, I understand what high-density living environment is about. My family and I are living in a small flat. It is always a headache for us to keep our home tidy because we have a lot of stuffs but with limited spaces. This is how "Sharers" idea came along. We together can actaully do something good to help out the people around us, and at the same time, not wasting anything useful.
