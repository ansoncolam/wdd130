    <p>Hello, I'm Anson and I'm from Hong Kong, a small city but with large population located in southern China.
        This is my first semester in BYU-Idaho and my major is in Applied Technology.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for more than 25 years.
        My parents brought me to church when I was young, and I'm very grateful for that.
        One of my favorite scriptures is in Alma chapter 32 verse 21 in The Book of Mormon, it reads,
        "And now as I said concerning faithâ€”faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things; 
        therefore if ye have faith ye hope for things which are not seen, which are true."
        I believe we all need this kind of faith in order to face challeges in this life.</p>
    <p>My hobby would be reading, hiking, and swimming.</p>
    <p>Thank you for looking at my web page!</p>
